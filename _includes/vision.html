        Bokeh is a Python interactive visualization library that targets modern web browsers for presentation.
        Its goal is to provide elegant, concise construction of basic exploratory and advanced custom graphics in the style of D3, but also deliver this capability with high-performance interactivity over very large or streaming datasets.
        Bokeh should help anyone who would like to quickly and easily create interactive plots, dashboards, and data applications.

          The development pace of Bokeh is contigent on external funding opportunities, so instead of a traditional “roadmap” with specific dates and deadlines, we present the major areas of work the Core Team considers important.
          These are tasks and projects that we would like to do ourselves, when time and resources permit, or that we would be happy to have done by new contributors.
